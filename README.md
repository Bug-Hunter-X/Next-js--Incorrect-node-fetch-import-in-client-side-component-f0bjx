# Next.js: Incorrect node-fetch import in client-side component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications involving the incorrect use of `node-fetch` in client-side components.  The `about.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `aboutSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**

Attempting to use `node-fetch` directly within a client-side component leads to runtime errors because `node-fetch` is designed for server-side environments.  Client-side fetching should utilize browser APIs like `fetch` which is natively available.

**Solution:**

The corrected code in `aboutSolution.js` uses the built-in `fetch` API for client-side data retrieval.  This ensures compatibility and avoids runtime errors.
